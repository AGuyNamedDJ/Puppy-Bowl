# Puppy-Bowl

Most people, even if they haven't watched it, have heard of the Super Bowl. But have you ever heard of the "Puppy Bowl"? Well, it's quite literally a Super Bowl level event, only for puppies competing to be the cutest amongst themselves!

API

We are interacting with the "Puppy Bowl" API Fullstack Academy has built that hosts the data we'll need about each puppy, each of their owners, and even the teams they are on. We will make certain requests to our API to get the appropriate data you'll need, save that to the state of your React app, and then build various React components to visually represent that state to our users.
